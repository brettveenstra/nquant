nQuant
======

_nQuant_ is a library for the compression of PNG image files. It reduces
the size of PNG images by converting them from 32-bit-per-pixel ARGB images
to 8-bit-per-pixel indexed colour images.

This library determines the best 256 colours into use in the resulting palette
such that image quality is preserved as much as possible.
